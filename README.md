# Cybersecurity Network Analysis Task: IP Addressing & Subnetting

This repository documents my lab work on analyzing network addressing schemes, creating subnet plans, and validating host configurations for secure and efficient network communication.

---

##  Objective

- Understand and apply IP addressing concepts (IPv4 & IPv6).
- Perform subnetting to segment networks according to design requirements.
- Verify network configurations through analysis and testing.
- Demonstrate calculations for usable hosts, network addresses, and broadcast addresses.
- Apply addressing strategies for cybersecurity lab environments.

---

##  Tools & Environment

- **Operating Systems:** Windows 11, Ubuntu (CLI & GUI)
- **Networking Tools:** `ipconfig`, `ifconfig`, `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`
- **Diagramming:** draw.io / Lucidchart for network topology
- **Packet Analysis:** Wireshark
- **Virtualization:** VirtualBox (for isolated lab networks)

---

##  Task Steps

### 1. IP Addressing Analysis
- Identified current IP configuration using:
  ```powershell
  ipconfig /all     # Windows
  ifconfig          # Linux

### 2. Subnetting Plan
Given a base network: 192.168.10.0/24

Required: 5 subnets with at least 30 hosts each.

Calculation:

Host requirement: 30 ‚Üí Need 5 bits for hosts (2^5 - 2 = 30 usable)

New mask: /27 (255.255.255.224)

Number of subnets: 2^(borrowed bits) = 8

Resulting subnets:

Subnet #	Network Address	Usable Range	Broadcast Address
1	192.168.10.0	192.168.10.1‚Äì192.168.10.30	192.168.10.31
2	192.168.10.32	192.168.10.33‚Äì192.168.10.62	192.168.10.63
3	192.168.10.64	192.168.10.65‚Äì192.168.10.94	192.168.10.95
4	192.168.10.96	192.168.10.97‚Äì192.168.10.126	192.168.10.127
5	192.168.10.128	192.168.10.129‚Äì192.168.10.158	192.168.10.159

3. Address Assignment
Assigned first usable IP in each subnet to gateway/router.

Allocated static IPs for servers, dynamic range for clients.

Ensured no overlap and documented assignments in an IP Address Table.

4. Verification & Testing
Used ping and traceroute to confirm connectivity.

Captured ARP and ICMP traffic in Wireshark to observe network behavior.

Verified subnet isolation by attempting cross-subnet communication.

## üß™ Protocol Labs

### 1. DNS Resolution

**Goal:** Analyze how DNS converts human-readable domains to IP addresses.

**What I Did:**
- Used tools like `dig`, `nslookup`, and `host` on Ubuntu.
- Captured traffic using Wireshark.
- Examined DNS Query and Response packets.

**Key Observations:**
- Identified recursive and iterative queries.
- Tracked full domain resolution path.



---

### 2. ICMP (Ping) Traffic

**Goal:** Understand ICMP echo requests/replies and TTL behavior.

**What I Did:**
- Ran `ping` and `traceroute` commands across internal and external hosts.
- Analyzed live ICMP packets in Wireshark.
- Measured latency, packet size, TTL values.
