#  Cyber Lab

This repository documents hands-on cybersecurity labs and protocol analyses using virtualized environments. It includes protocol dissections (DNS, ICMP), VM installations, IP subneting, OS configurations, and packet inspections‚Äîall conducted within a local VirtualBox setup.

##  Lab Environment

- **Host Machine:** Windows 11, Macbook
- **Virtualization Tool:** VirtualBox
- **Virtual Machines Used:**  
  - Ubuntu (CLI and GUI)  
  - CentOS  
  - Windows 11  
- **Tools:**  
  - Wireshark  
  - Terminal utilities (`ping`, `dig`, `nslookup`, `traceroute`)  
  - System configuration tools  
  - Packet analysis

## üß™ Protocol Labs

### 1. DNS Resolution

**Goal:** Analyze how DNS converts human-readable domains to IP addresses.

**What I Did:**
- Used tools like `dig`, `nslookup`, and `host` on Ubuntu.
- Captured traffic using Wireshark.
- Examined DNS Query and Response packets.

**Key Observations:**
- Identified recursive and iterative queries.
- Tracked full domain resolution path.



---

### 2. ICMP (Ping) Traffic

**Goal:** Understand ICMP echo requests/replies and TTL behavior.

**What I Did:**
- Ran `ping` and `traceroute` commands across internal and external hosts.
- Analyzed live ICMP packets in Wireshark.
- Measured latency, packet size, TTL values.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Configuration

Detailed specs of host machine and VM settings.

- CPU Virtualization: Enabled
- RAM: 16 GB
- VirtualBox: [Insert Version]
- Disk Images: Dynamically allocated VDI



---

## ‚úÖ Skills Practiced

- Virtual Machine provisioning and troubleshooting  
- DNS and ICMP protocol inspection  
- Basic network forensics  
- OS installation and configuration  
- Wireshark analysis fundamentals  
- CLI tool use across multiple distros

---

## üìå Next Steps

- Add firewall rule testing and logging  
- Configure DNS caching server and observe TTL expiry  
- Simulate MITM attacks in isolated network  
- Document and compare ICMP behavior under blocked ports/firewalls  
- Automate VM creation via Vagrant or Ansible

# Active Directory Homelab

End-to-end Windows AD lab: two domain controllers, DNS, domain joins, OU/GPO management, replication health, Windows Admin Center, and basic network validation (ICMP, port checks). All steps are reproducible and evidenced with screenshots and command outputs.

## Lab Snapshot

- **Forest/domain:** `cyberlearnssh.local`
- **Functional level:** 2016
- **Controllers:** `FRA02-WS-DC01` (Primary), `LAG02-WS-DC02` (Secondary)
- **Services:** AD DS, DNS, DFSR (SYSVOL), GPMC
- **Mgmt:** Windows Admin Center for servers and workstations

---
## What‚Äôs in this repo

- **Connectivity checks**
  - Continuous ping by IP (batch)
  - Quick PowerShell port tests (RDP 3389, DNS 53)
- **Active Directory**
  - Promote DC01, set functional level 2016
  - Add DC02 and verify replication
  - Create users, join servers/workstations
  - Organize OUs and link GPOs
- **DNS**
  - Fix gateway, validate forward and reverse lookups
  - `nslookup` sanity checks
- **Health**
  - `repadmin /replsummary`
  - `dcdiag` on both DCs
- **Management**
  - Windows Admin Center views
  - Shared folder permissions evidence

---

## Environment & prerequisites

- Hypervisor or lab network (VirtualBox/VMware/Hyper-V)
- Windows Server for DCs (2016+ recommended)
- At least one Windows client, one server member
- Local admin on all VMs
- Internet optional (used for updates/WAC access)
